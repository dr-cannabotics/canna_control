### Project Description: Automated Cannabis Grow Light Control System

**Objective:**
Develop a sophisticated automated lighting control system for cannabis cultivation that simulates natural sunlight cycles, adjusts light intensity and duration for various growth stages, and offers real-time updates and manual adjustments.

**System Overview:**

1. **Automated Light Scheduling:**
   - **Modes:** The system automatically adjusts light intensity and duration for four growth stagesâ€”SEEDLING, VEG, BLOOM, and RIPEN. Each mode is tailored to optimize plant development:
     - **SEEDLING:** Low light intensity to support early growth.
     - **VEG:** Medium light intensity for vigorous vegetative growth.
     - **BLOOM:** Full light intensity to enhance flowering and fruiting.
     - **RIPEN:** Medium light intensity to improve final maturation.

   - **Sunrise/Sunset Simulation:**
     - **Sunrise Simulation:** Gradually increases light intensity from low to high using PWM signals, replicating the natural gradual increase in sunlight during sunrise. This slow ramp-up helps in acclimating plants to increasing light levels, promoting healthy growth.
     - **Sunset Simulation:** Gradually decreases light intensity from high to low using PWM signals, mimicking the natural gradual decrease in sunlight during sunset. This slow ramp-down aids in reducing plant stress and prepares plants for nighttime rest.

2. **Manual Mode Selection:**
   - **Rotary Encoder:** Provides users with the ability to manually select and adjust light modes, allowing for customization beyond automated schedules.

3. **Real-Time Display:**
   - **LCD Screen (16x2 with I2C Interface):** Shows the current light mode, intensity, and system status. The backlit display ensures clear visibility in various lighting conditions.

4. **Accurate Timekeeping:**
   - **RTC Module (DS3231):** Ensures precise management of light schedules, maintaining consistent light transitions based on the time of day.

| **Rotary Encoder**                 | Allows manual selection and adjustment of light modes, enabling users to cycle through SEEDLING, VEG, BLOOM, and RIPEN stages. |
| **Real-Time Clock (RTC) Module (DS3231)** | Ensures accurate timing for managing light schedules.                                                 |
| **Connecting Wires and Breadboard** | Facilitates connections between components and the Arduino during prototyping.                      |

This system offers a reliable, automated solution for cannabis cultivation by replicating natural light conditions, ensuring optimal growth through precise control and adjustments.
