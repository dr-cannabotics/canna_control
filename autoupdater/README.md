### Project Description: Pico W Background Firmware Updater

#### Overview
The **Pico W Background Firmware Updater** is a robust system designed to keep Raspberry Pi Pico W devices up-to-date with the latest firmware releases. By integrating with GitHub, the system automatically checks for new firmware versions, downloads them, and installs the updates—all while running in the background. This ensures that the device can continue performing its primary functions without interruption, making it ideal for IoT deployments where manual updates are impractical.

#### Key Features

- **Automated Wi-Fi Connectivity**: The device automatically connects to a pre-configured Wi-Fi network to access the internet for firmware updates.
  
- **GitHub Integration**: The updater uses the GitHub API to fetch the latest firmware release from a specified repository, ensuring the device always runs the most recent and secure firmware.

- **Background Processing**: The update process runs in a separate thread, allowing the device’s main application to continue running without any downtime during updates.

- **Firmware Verification**: Includes a placeholder for SHA-256 checksum verification to ensure the downloaded firmware is authentic and hasn't been tampered with.

- **Safe Flashing**: Firmware is safely downloaded to a temporary file and only flashed after successful verification, reducing the risk of corrupting the device.

#### Components

1. **`FirmwareUpdater` Class**: 
   - Handles all aspects of the update process, including connecting to Wi-Fi, downloading firmware, verifying its integrity, and flashing the device.
   
2. **`start_update_process()` Function**: 
   - Initiates the firmware update in a separate background thread, enabling continuous operation of the device's primary application.

3. **Main Application Integration**: 
   - Allows seamless integration into any existing Pico W project, with the updater running independently in the background.

#### How It Works

1. **Wi-Fi Connection**: The updater first ensures the Pico W is connected to the specified Wi-Fi network. If the connection fails, it retries multiple times before giving up, providing feedback during the process.

2. **Firmware Check**: It queries the GitHub repository for the latest firmware release. If a new release is available, it retrieves the download URL.

3. **Download and Verify**: The updater downloads the firmware file in chunks to prevent memory overflow. Once downloaded, the file's integrity is checked using a SHA-256 hash.

4. **Flash and Reboot**: If the firmware passes verification, it is flashed onto the device, and the device is automatically rebooted to apply the update.

#### How to Use It

1. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   - Ensure MicroPython is installed on your Pico W.
   - Set up a development environment like Thonny for uploading and running scripts.

2. **Configure the Updater**:
   - Create a `firmware_update.py` file on your Pico W.
   - Replace the placeholders (`your_SSID`, `your_PASSWORD`, `your_username`, and `your_repository`) with your actual Wi-Fi credentials and GitHub repository details.

3. **Integrate with Your Main Application**:
   - Import the `firmware_update` module in your main script.
   - Call `firmware_update.start_update_process()` at the beginning of your main script to initiate the background update process.

4. **Run Your Application**:
   - The firmware updater will run in the background, periodically checking for and applying updates, while your main application continues to operate normally.

#### Example Usage

```python
import time
import firmware_update

# Start the firmware update process in the background
firmware_update.start_update_process()

# Main application loop
while True:
    # Your main application logic here
    print("Main application running...")
    time.sleep(10)
```

#### Benefits

- **Minimal Downtime**: The device continues to operate while updates are applied, reducing disruption.
- **Enhanced Security**: Regular updates ensure the device is protected against known vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability**: Ideal for large-scale IoT deployments where manual updates are impractical.

#### Potential Applications

- **IoT Devices**: Ensure remote IoT devices remain secure and functional with the latest firmware.
- **Home Automation**: Keep smart home devices up-to-date without manual intervention.
- **Educational Projects**: Demonstrate the concepts of OTA (Over-The-Air) updates in IoT systems.

### Conclusion

The **Pico W Background Firmware Updater** provides a reliable, automated solution for keeping Raspberry Pi Pico W devices updated with the latest firmware. By running updates in the background, it ensures that devices remain operational and secure, making it a valuable tool for both hobbyist and professional IoT projects.
