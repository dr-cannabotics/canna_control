### Project Description: Pico W Background Firmware Updater

#### Overview
This project focuses on creating a robust and efficient background firmware update system for the Raspberry Pi Pico W using MicroPython. The system is designed to automatically check for, download, and install the latest firmware from a GitHub repository, ensuring that the device remains up-to-date with the latest features and security patches without manual intervention.

#### Key Features
- **Automatic Wi-Fi Connection**: The device automatically connects to a specified Wi-Fi network, providing internet access required for checking and downloading firmware updates.
- **GitHub Integration**: The system is integrated with GitHub, using the GitHub API to check for the latest firmware releases in a specified repository.
- **Background Update Process**: The firmware update process runs in the background, allowing the main application to continue running without interruption.
- **Secure Firmware Verification**: Includes a placeholder for SHA-256 checksum verification to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded firmware.
- **Safe Flashing Mechanism**: The firmware is downloaded to a temporary file and flashed to the device only after successful verification, minimizing the risk of bricking the device.

#### Components

1. **FirmwareUpdater Class**:
   - **connect_to_wifi()**: Manages the connection to the Wi-Fi network, retrying up to a set limit before failing.
   - **get_latest_firmware_url()**: Interacts with the GitHub API to fetch the URL of the latest firmware release.
   - **download_firmware(url)**: Downloads the firmware binary from the provided URL in chunks, ensuring efficient use of memory.
   - **verify_firmware(firmware_data)**: Provides a placeholder for verifying the integrity of the downloaded firmware using SHA-256 hashing.
   - **flash_firmware()**: Safely flashes the firmware to the device and resets it to apply the update.

2. **start_update_process()**:
   - A function that initiates the firmware update process in a separate thread, enabling the main application to run concurrently.

3. **Main Application Script**:
   - A simple loop that represents the primary function of the Pico W, running alongside the background firmware update process.

#### Usage
1. **Initialization**:
   - Set the Wi-Fi SSID and password, GitHub username, and repository name in the `firmware_update.py` module.
   - Import the `firmware_update` module in your main application script.

2. **Starting the Update Process**:
   - Call `firmware_update.start_update_process()` at the beginning of your main script to start the firmware update process in the background.

3. **Running the Main Application**:
   - The main application can continue running its primary tasks without being affected by the firmware update process.

#### Benefits
- **Minimized Downtime**: The background update mechanism ensures that firmware updates do not interrupt the deviceâ€™s primary functions.
- **Enhanced Security**: Regular firmware updates can be automatically applied, enhancing the security and stability of the device.
- **Ease of Use**: The system requires minimal user intervention, making it suitable for deployment in various IoT applications where accessibility to the device may be limited.

#### Potential Use Cases
- **IoT Devices**: Keep firmware up-to-date on IoT devices deployed in remote or inaccessible locations.
- **Prototyping**: Rapid development and deployment of features by automating the firmware update process.
- **Educational Projects**: Teach students about over-the-air (OTA) updates and IoT device management.

### Conclusion
The Pico W Background Firmware Updater provides a reliable, easy-to-use solution for automating firmware updates on Raspberry Pi Pico W devices. By running the update process in the background, this system ensures that the device remains up-to-date without interrupting its primary functions, making it ideal for both hobbyist projects and professional IoT deployments.
