### **Key Modules**

#### **1. Pump Controller (`pump.py`)**

**Description:**  
The `PumpController` module manages water and nutrient pumps, essential for precise irrigation and nutrient delivery. It controls pump activation based on soil moisture and irrigation schedules, ensuring optimal plant hydration and nutrient uptake.

**Functionality:**
- **Initialize Pump:** Configures the GPIO pin to control the pump.
- **Activate/Deactivate:** Turns the pump ON/OFF.
- **Set State:** Switches the pump state based on input.

**Usage Example:**
```python
from pump import PumpController

# Initialize pump on GPIO pin 15
pump = PumpController(15)

# Activate the pump
pump.activate()

# Deactivate the pump
pump.deactivate()
```

#### **2. Light Controller (`light.py`)**

**Description:**  
The `LightController` module regulates grow lights, including their ON/OFF state and intensity. It adjusts light cycles and brightness to simulate natural conditions and support plant growth stages from seedling to flowering.

**Functionality:**
- **Turn On/Off:** Controls light activation.
- **Set Intensity:** Adjusts light brightness.

**Usage Example:**
```python
from light import LightController

# Initialize light on GPIO pin 17
light = LightController(17)

# Turn on the light
light.turn_on()

# Turn off the light
light.turn_off()
```

#### **3. Temperature and Humidity Controller (`env_control.py`)**

**Description:**  
The `EnvController` module automates temperature and humidity management within the cultivation area. It regulates cooling systems, fans, and humidifiers to maintain ideal environmental conditions for plant health.

**Functionality:**
- **Set Temperature:** Adjusts cooling systems for temperature control.
- **Set Humidity:** Manages humidifiers for optimal humidity levels.

**Usage Example:**
```python
from env_control import EnvController

# Initialize environment control on GPIO pins
env = EnvController(temp_pin=18, humidity_pin=19)

# Set temperature to 72Â°F
env.set_temperature(72)

# Set humidity to 50%
env.set_humidity(50)
```

#### **4. CO2 and O2 Controller (`gas_control.py`)**

**Description:**  
The `GasController` module regulates CO2 and O2 levels to boost plant growth. It manages CO2 enrichment and O2 ventilation based on the plant's growth phase and environmental requirements.

**Functionality:**
- **Set CO2 Levels:** Controls CO2 concentration.
- **Set O2 Levels:** Manages O2 levels for adequate ventilation.

**Usage Example:**
```python
from gas_control import GasController

# Initialize gas control on GPIO pins
gas = GasController(co2_pin=20, o2_pin=21)

# Set CO2 level to 1500 ppm
gas.set_co2_level(1500)

# Set O2 level to normal
gas.set_o2_level('normal')
```

#### **5. Sensor Data Logger (`sensor_logger.py`)**

**Description:**  
The `SensorLogger` module collects and logs data from various sensors (temperature, humidity, soil moisture). It stores this data in a time-series database for real-time monitoring and historical analysis.

**Functionality:**
- **Log Data:** Continuously records sensor readings.
- **Retrieve Data:** Provides access to historical sensor data.

**Usage Example:**
```python
from sensor_logger import SensorLogger

# Initialize sensor logger
logger = SensorLogger()

# Log current sensor data
logger.log_data()

# Retrieve historical data
data = logger.retrieve_data()
```

---

#### **6. Web Dashboard Interface (`dashboard.py`)**

**Description:**  
The `Dashboard` module provides a web-based interface for real-time system monitoring and control. It visualizes sensor data and allows remote interaction with the system, offering insights and management capabilities from any location.

**Functionality:**
- **Display Data:** Shows real-time and historical data.
- **Control Devices:** Toggles devices and adjusts settings through the web interface.

**Usage Example:**
```python
from dashboard import Dashboard

# Initialize dashboard
dashboard = Dashboard()

# Access real-time data
dashboard.show_real_time_data()

# Control a device via the dashboard
dashboard.toggle_device('pump', 'ON')
```
