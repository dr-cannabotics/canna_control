### Automated Cannabis Cultivation System

The **Automated Cannabis Cultivation System** is an advanced solution aimed at optimizing the cannabis growing environment using Arduino and Raspberry Pi technologies. The system manages critical factors like temperature, CO2 levels, light schedules, and nutrient delivery with high precision. It features a Real-Time Clock (RTC) to automate light cycles and environmental controls, while data logging with InfluxDB and visualization with Grafana provide comprehensive insights into system performance and plant growth. An optional web interface allows for remote monitoring and control, and the system can be expanded to include hydroponic nutrient management for advanced cultivation.

### Personal Motivation

This project stemmed from an initial experiment with a small hydroponic kitchen garden, which, despite basic equipment, yielded unsatisfactory results. This experience highlighted the need for a more efficient cultivation approach. Motivated to enhance growing conditions, I developed this Automated Cannabis Cultivation System to leverage Arduino and Raspberry Pi technologies, creating a sophisticated, automated environment that maximizes plant growth and simplifies the cultivation process.
