Automated Cannabis Cultivation System with Arduino
Project Overview

The Automated Cannabis Cultivation System is an advanced Arduino-based project designed to automate the management of a cannabis grow environment. The system incorporates temperature regulation, CO2 control, light scheduling for different growth stages, and real-time clock (RTC) functionality to ensure optimal plant growth conditions and improve overall yields.
Features

    Temperature Control: Automatically regulates temperature using a cooling system.
    CO2 Management: Monitors and manages CO2 levels to enhance plant growth (optional).
    Light Scheduling: Provides automated light cycles tailored to different growth phases: Seedling, Vegetative, and Flowering.
    Real-Time Clock (RTC): Utilizes RTC to maintain accurate light schedules.
    Data Logging: Records sensor data for performance tracking and analysis.
    Web Interface (Optional): Enables remote monitoring and control using a Wi-Fi module.
