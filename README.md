**Automated Cannabis Cultivation System**

The Automated Cannabis Cultivation System is an advanced solution designed to optimize the growing environment for cannabis plants using Arduino and Raspberry Pi technologies. This system integrates precise control over temperature, CO2 and O2 levels, light schedules, ventilation, nutrient delivery, and irrigation to enhance plant growth and simplify the cultivation process.

**Personal Motivation**

The project originated from an initial experiment with a basic hydroponic kitchen garden, where limited equipment resulted in low yields and rudimentary processes. Recognizing the need for improved cultivation efficiency, this system was developed to leverage Arduino and Raspberry Pi technologies, aiming to create a sophisticated, automated environment that maximizes plant growth and simplifies the cultivation process.

        - **CO2 Overdrive Mode:**
            - CO2 Levels: Increases CO2 up to 2000 ppm during flowering (ensure proper ventilation).
            - Ventilation Control: Intensifies airflow to accommodate higher CO2 levels and prevent heat buildup.
    - **Control Algorithm:** Regulates CO2 levels by managing generators or bottles and monitors O2 levels, adjusting ventilation accordingly.

3. **Light Scheduling with SANlight Control**

    Description: Automates light cycles and intensity using SANlight LEDs and their integrated app, with additional control over 0-10V inputs for customized sunrise and sunset cycles.
    - **Growth Stages:**
        - Seedling Stage: 18-24 hours/day
        - Vegetative Phase: 18 hours light, 6 hours darkness
        - Flowering Phase: 12 hours light, 12 hours darkness
    - **Light Intensity:** Adjusts based on growth stage; higher during vegetative phase, reduced during flowering.
    - **Dimmed Sunrise and Sunset Simulation:** Gradually adjusts light intensity via SANlight's 0-10V inputs to mimic natural sunrise and sunset.
    - **Control Algorithm:** Uses an RTC module to implement precise light schedules and manage SANlight's 0-10V inputs for simulating natural light cycles.

4. **Pump Control for Automated Irrigation with Soil Moisture Sensing**

    Description: Manages irrigation schedules and soil moisture levels to optimize hydration based on plant growth stages.
    - **Growth Stages:**
        - Seedling: Light watering.
        - Vegetative Growth (VEG): Moderate watering.
        - Flowering (BLOOM): Increased watering.
        - Ripening (RIPEN): Reduced watering with clean water only, no fertilizer.
    - **Soil Moisture Sensing and Thresholds:**
        - Dry Threshold: Triggers irrigation when moisture falls below this level (e.g., 400).
        - Wet Threshold: Prevents over-watering when moisture exceeds this level (e.g., 600).
    - **Manual Mode Selection:** Allows for manual adjustments of irrigation modes and thresholds using a rotary encoder.
    - **Real-Time Display:** Uses an LCD screen to show current mode, soil moisture level, pump status, and irrigation schedule.
    - **Accurate Timekeeping:** An RTC module manages precise timing for scheduled irrigation.
    - **Pump Control:** Uses a relay module to control the water pump based on moisture readings and thresholds.

        - Pre-Mixed Nutrient Solution Tank: Contains a ready-to-use nutrient mix.
        - Three Separate Tanks: Used for mixing custom nutrient solutions before delivery.
    - **Pumps:** Multiple pumps are utilized to deliver the prepared nutrient solution from each tank to multiple plants, ensuring precise and consistent nutrient distribution.
    - **Magnetic Stirring Controllers:** The nutrient solutions are held in glass pods equipped with magnetic stirring controllers, ensuring that the solutions remain well-mixed and homogenous during the entire cultivation process.
    - **Control Algorithm:** Automates the preparation and distribution of nutrient solutions using precise timing and mixing algorithms to ensure optimal nutrient delivery.

6. **Real-Time Monitoring, Data Logging, and Visualization**
