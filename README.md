### Automated Cannabis Cultivation System

The **Automated Cannabis Cultivation System** is a sophisticated solution designed to optimize the growing environment for cannabis plants using Arduino and Raspberry Pi technologies. The system precisely controls critical factors such as temperature, CO2 levels, light schedules, ventilation, and nutrient delivery. A Real-Time Clock (RTC) ensures accurate timing for automated management of light cycles and environmental conditions. Data logging with InfluxDB provides insights into system performance and plant growth, while Grafana is used for visualization and monitoring. An optional web interface allows for remote monitoring and control, and the system can be expanded to include hydroponic nutrient management for advanced cultivation.

### Personal Motivation

The inspiration for this project came from an initial experiment with a small hydroponic kitchen garden, where basic equipment like a lamp and a window were used to regulate the environment. Despite its simplicity, the yield was low and the process rudimentary. This experience underscored the need for improved efficiency in cultivation. Driven by a desire to enhance growing conditions, I developed this Automated Cannabis Cultivation System to leverage Arduino and Raspberry Pi technologies, creating a sophisticated, automated environment that maximizes plant growth and simplifies the cultivation process.
