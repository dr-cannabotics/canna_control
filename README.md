### Automated Cannabis Cultivation System

The **Automated Cannabis Cultivation System** is an advanced solution designed to optimize the growing environment for cannabis plants using Arduino and Raspberry Pi technologies. This system integrates precise control over temperature, CO2 levels, light schedules, ventilation, and nutrient delivery to enhance plant growth and simplify the cultivation process.

#### **Personal Motivation**

The project originated from an initial experiment with a basic hydroponic kitchen garden, where limited equipment resulted in low yields and rudimentary processes.
